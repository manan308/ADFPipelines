# ADFPipelines
Created Multiple ADF pipelines for ingestion purpose
ðŸš€ Azure Data Factory â€“ End-to-End Data Pipelines

This repository showcases multiple Azure Data Factory (ADF) pipelines designed for end-to-end data integration and transformation from diverse data sources â€” including on-premise databases, flat files, APIs, and CSV datasets â€” into cloud data storage and processing layers.

ðŸ“‚ Project Overview

The goal of these pipelines is to demonstrate real-world data engineering scenarios such as:

Extracting data from on-prem databases using Self-Hosted Integration Runtime

Ingesting flat files and CSVs from local and cloud storage (e.g., Azure Blob / Data Lake)

Integrating REST APIs and handling JSON/XML payloads

Performing data transformation and mapping using Data Flow activities

Loading curated data into Azure SQL Database, Synapse, or Data Lake Zones (Raw â†’ Staging â†’ Curated)
